/**
 * Encapsulates the process of collating and distributing the Messages - in both
 * directions - as needed on the client side.
 * 
 * Receives Messages from Display and stores them
 * 
 * Urgently polls Gatekeeper for Messages from the server when GameLogic asks for its Messages
 * 
 * GameLogic says ‘tick x is starting, give me my messages!’
 * 		- Urgently ask the Gatekeeper for the full set of all messages for tick x from the server.
 * 		- If the messages are all there, give them to GameLogic
 * 		- If they aren’t, throw an exception or return something special, GameLogic will deal with it from there.
 * 		- On success
 * 			Pack up all Messages due to be sent to the server and send them with a tick id of x + k, where k is
 * 			some positive integral constant.
